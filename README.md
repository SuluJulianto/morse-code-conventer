## Morse Code Converter

### Overview
This Python program converts text to Morse code and vice versa using a simple Morse code dictionary. It utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to encapsulate the functionality.

### Usage
1. **Run the Program:**
    - Execute the `main` block in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` section.
    - Input your text (name or message) when prompted.

2. **Conversion:**
    - The program converts the input text to Morse code and displays the result.
    - It also performs the reverse conversion, translating Morse code back to the original text.

### Class Methods
1. **`convert_to_morse(text: str) -> str`:**
    - Converts the input text to Morse code.
    - Returns a string with each character separated by a newline.

2. **`convert_to_text(morse_code: str) -> str`:**
    - Converts Morse code back to the original text.
    - Assumes Morse code characters are separated by newlines.

### Note
- Morse code representations are displayed using underscores and dots.
- Spaces are represented by a series of underscores for better visibility.

Feel free to use and modify the code for your Morse code conversion needs!
